She takes the appearance of the infamous [`male_07`][male_07] model from
[Half-Life 2], although only her lower body is seen in-game.

## Trivia

* She has a **NeutronMail** account, which is a reference to [ProtonMail]. The
  account's address is `buttmccrack@neutronmail.com`.
* In Gar28, one of the bathroom stalls is always locked with the SBS2024 main
  theme playing from within. This is likely a reference to Butt McCrack.
