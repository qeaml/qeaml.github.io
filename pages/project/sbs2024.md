**Shitting Bricks Simulator 2024** is the sequel to the critically-acclaimed
[*Shitting Bricks Simulator 2022*](sbs2022), bringing tons of changes and
upgrades to the original game.

Most notably, the game has significantly expanded gameplay. The player must now
properly time their clicks in order to shit without running out of breath.
Running out of breath is now a much more severe punishment by causing a longer
cooldown compared to the original game.

The game's graphics were also upgraded, now featuring a toilet and a protagonist
(Butt McCrack).

Additionally, the game now features progression via purchasable items. With the
score you earn by shitting bricks you can purchase various items that make it
easier to shit bricks, from lube to weird, physics-defying, gravity-altered
devices.

The game ends once you purchase a supermassive black hole that consumes the
universe as you know and allows you to start over. (Although, this new universe
may have something the previous one didn't, *wink*)

Unlike the original game, SBS2024 uses the [nwge](nwge) engine. The original
used the [Godot] engine. You can view the SBS2024 source code [on
GitHub][GitHub].

SBS2024 originally released on **May 31st, 2024**.
